function ionList = ionsCreateComplex(elements,complexity,isotopeTable,chargeStates)
% ionsCreateComplex creates a list of all complex ions that can be formed
% by the given elements, based on the isotopeTable. chargeStates are
% optional, default is +1 - +3
%
% WARNING: the number of permutations of ions grows with the Gamma
% function. Beware when creating very large complexities
%
% elements is a cellStr in the form {'Fe','Cr','O',...} and can be directly
% extracted e.g. from the decomposed pos file, as a keyword, 'all' can be
% used. This uses all elements up to 
%
% complexity is the complexites in vector form, e.g. [1 2 3]
